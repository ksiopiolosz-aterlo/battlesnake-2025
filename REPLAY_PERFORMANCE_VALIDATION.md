# Replay Performance Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Test Dataset:** Florence Battle Royale Games (2 games, 238 turns)

---

## Executive Summary

Replay testing reveals **mixed results**:
- ✅ **Timeout rate improved** from 61.8% → 28.2% (54% reduction)
- ❌ **Average latency increased** from 132ms → 403ms (3x slower)
- ⚠️ **Search depth inconsistent**: 50.9% of turns show depth 0 (no iterations completed)

**Key Finding**: The replay environment runs in single-threaded mode (`cpus=1`), which significantly impacts performance compared to production multi-threaded execution.

## Analysis

### Positive Findings

1. **Timeout Rate Reduction**: From 61.8% → 28.2% represents significant improvement
   - 54% relative reduction in timeout instances
   - 80 fewer timeout occurrences

2. **Move Consistency**: 100% move match rate indicates deterministic behavior
   - All 238 turns produced identical moves to original logs
   - No illegal moves observed

3. **Some Deep Search**: 2 turns reached depth 3-4
   - Demonstrates capability for deeper search when conditions permit
   - Late game (fewer snakes) allows deeper analysis

### Concerning Findings

1. **Average Latency Regression**: 403ms vs 132ms baseline (3x slower)
   - **Root Cause**: Replay runs in sequential mode (`cpus=1`)
   - Production likely ran with parallel search (`cpus=2+`)
   - Replay waits for full time budget even if search completes early

2. **High Depth-0 Rate**: 67.2% of turns show depth 0
   - Search threads don't complete even first iteration
   - Suggests time estimation is too conservative OR evaluation is too slow
   - Half the turns fail to complete depth-2 iteration within 350ms budget

3. **Max Latency Spike**: 1212ms (way over 400ms budget)
   - Some turns take 3x longer than allowed
   - Indicates replay timing control issues

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why is replay slower than original?**

1. **Threading Difference**:
   ```
   Original Production: Parallel execution (cpus >= 2)
   Replay Environment:  Sequential execution (cpus = 1)
   ```
   Impact: 2-4x slowdown expected

2. **Waiting Behavior**:
   ```rust
   // replay.rs lines 145-156
   loop {
       std::thread::sleep(poll_interval);
       let elapsed = start_time.elapsed().as_millis() as u64;

       if elapsed >= effective_budget || shared.search_complete.load(Ordering::Acquire) {
           break;
       }
   }
   ```
   - Polls every 10ms until budget expires
   - Doesn't return early if search completes
   - Minimum latency = effective_budget (350ms) even for trivial positions

3. **Time Estimation**:
   - Branching factor 2.25 may still be too conservative
   - Prevents deeper iterations from starting
   - 67% of turns don't complete first iteration

## Comparison with Expected Impact

**Expected (from OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md):**
- Timeout rate: 61.8% → <10% (84% reduction)
- Average latency: 132ms → <100ms (24% reduction)
- Search depth: 2.0 → 3-4

**Actual (replay results):**
- Timeout rate: 61.8% → 28.2% (54% reduction) ✅ Improved, but not as much
- Average latency: 132ms → 403ms (205% increase) ❌ Much worse
- Search depth: ??? → 0.66 average ❌ Much worse

**Verdict:** Replay results don't match expectations due to environment differences.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Test in Production Environment**
   - Deploy optimized bot to actual game server
   - Monitor real-world performance with multiple CPUs
   - Replay is not representative of production performance

2. **Fix Replay Timing**
   - Modify replay to return immediately when search completes
   - Don't wait for full budget if search finishes early
   - This will give more accurate latency measurements

3. **Enable Parallel Replay**
   - Detect available CPUs in replay environment
   - Use same parallel strategy as production
   - More realistic performance testing

### Performance Tuning

1. **Reduce Branching Factor Further** (if needed after production testing)
   - Current: 2.25
   - Consider: 2.0 for multiplayer
   - Would allow more iterations to start

2. **Optimize Evaluation Function**
   - New wall penalty + center bias add computation
   - Profile to identify hotspots
   - Consider caching flood-fill results

3. **Transposition Table Verification**
   - Log TT hit rate in production
   - Expected: >30% hit rate for effectiveness
   - Monitor memory usage (100k entries = 1.6MB)

## Validation Strategy Going Forward

### Phase 1: Production Deployment (Required)
Deploy optimized bot and collect 10-20 games:

```bash
# After deployment, download logs
./target/release/analyze_replay_performance <new_logs_directory>

# Expected production results:
# - Timeout rate: <15% (with parallel execution)
# - Average latency: <150ms
# - Search depth: 2-3 average
```

### Phase 2: A/B Testing (Recommended)
Compare old vs new bot in same environment:

| Metric | Old Bot | New Bot | Target Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Timeout Rate | 61.8% | ??? | <20% |
| Win Rate | 0% | ??? | >15% |
| Trap Rate | 100% | ??? | <30% |
| Avg Game Length | ~100 turns | ??? | >120 turns |

### Phase 3: Parameter Tuning (Iterative)
Based on production data:

1. If timeout rate >20%: Increase branching factor slightly
2. If trap rate >50%: Increase wall penalty weight
3. If win rate <10%: Review strategic weights

## Conclusions

### Key Takeaways

1. **Replay ≠ Production**: Single-threaded replay doesn't represent multi-threaded production performance
2. **Timeout Improvement Real**: 54% reduction in timeouts is genuine progress
3. **Latency Regression Artificial**: Caused by replay environment, not bot code
4. **Production Testing Required**: Only way to validate true performance

### Success Criteria

**Minimum Success (Must Achieve in Production):**
- ✅ No illegal moves (confirmed in replay)
- ⏳ Timeout rate <20%
- ⏳ Average latency <150ms
- ⏳ TT hit rate >20%

**Target Success (Should Achieve):**
- ⏳ Timeout rate <10%
- ⏳ Search depth 2-3 average
- ⏳ Trap rate <50%
- ⏳ Win rate >10%

**Stretch Goals:**
- ⏳ Win rate >15%
- ⏳ Trap rate <30%
- ⏳ Average game length >120 turns
