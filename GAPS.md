## Version History

### V10 (Current) - Health-Aware Risk Assessment & Opponent Threat Filtering
**Status:** COMPLETED - January 2025
**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **Opponent Body Threat Filtering**: Only consider opponents threatening if head is close enough to trap us
- ✅ **Health-Aware Corner Danger**: Scale corner penalty by health (20% at critical <20, 50% at low 20-50, 100% at high >50)
- ✅ **More Aggressive Critical Health Multipliers**: Max multiplier for distance-2 food when health < 30 (was < 50)
- ✅ **Confirmed User Hypothesis**: Turn 82 opponent body at distance 2 caused food avoidance despite head at distance 4

**Motivation:**
- V9.1.2 Game 4 analysis revealed cascade of conservative decisions leading to starvation death
- Turn 82: Opponent body proximity caused safe food avoidance (user's hypothesis CONFIRMED ✅)
- Turn 87: Critical health (13) + adjacent food, but corner penalty overwhelmed food bonus → chose corner trap
- Root cause: Conservative penalties not health-aware, opponent bodies treated as threats regardless of head position

**Changes:**
```
Opponent Threat Filtering (src/bot.rs:2076-2108):
  - Added is_opponent_threatening() helper
  - Only consider opponent if head within (food_distance + 2), capped at 6
  - Modified compute_adversarial_entrapment_penalty() to filter opponents

Health-Aware Corner Danger (src/bot.rs:2409-2447):
  - Health < 20: 20% penalty (critical - accept corner risk for food)
  - Health 20-50: 50% penalty (low - reduced caution)
  - Health > 50: 100% penalty (high - full caution)

Critical Health Multipliers (src/bot.rs:1917-1951):
  - Distance 2, health < 30: ALWAYS max multiplier (was conditional at < 50)
  - More aggressive at 13-30 health range

Configuration (Snake.toml):
  - adversarial_body_threat_buffer = 2 (NEW)
  - adversarial_entrapment_distance = 4 (increased from 3)
```

**Replay Verification:**
- Turn 82: MATCHED (depth-2 tactical reasoning still conservative)
- Turn 86: MISMATCH - Changed from "down" (toward corner) → "left" (away from corner) ✅
- Turn 87: MISMATCH - Changed from "left" (corner trap → death) → "right" (eat food!) ✅
- Critical fix validated: Bot now eats adjacent food at health=13 instead of entering corner

**Expected Impact:**
- Fewer starvation deaths from conservative food avoidance
- Better risk assessment at critical health (<30)
- Less spooked by distant opponent bodies when heads aren't threatening
- Corners acceptable as last resort at very low health

**GAPS.md Corrections:**
- ❌ INCORRECT: "AdaptiveTimeEstimator Never Used" - It IS used (bot.rs:947, 1049)
- ❌ INCORRECT: "HashMap for Control Map" - Already uses Vec (bot.rs:1719)
- ❌ INCORRECT: "Conservative IDAPOS" - Already aggressive (multiplier=1, max_distance=5)

### V9.1.2 - Food Pursuit Optimization: Increased Multipliers for Uncontested Food
**Status:** COMPLETED - January 2025
**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **Increased urgency multipliers** for distance 2-5 food with clear opponent advantage
- ✅ **Health-aware food pursuit**: Max multiplier for distance-2 food when health < 50
- ✅ **Desperate mode**: Aggressive pursuit at critical health (<30) for nearby food (distance 3-4)
- ✅ **Better balance**: Higher multipliers (0.8x, 0.4x) vs V9.1.1 (0.3x, 0.1x) for uncontested food

**Motivation:**
- V9.1.1 analysis identified 27 cases where bot moved away from food with 3+ move advantage
- Investigation revealed multipliers for distance 2+ were too conservative (0.3x, 0.1x)
- These low multipliers could be overwhelmed by future penalties from search tree
- Solution: Increase multipliers while maintaining strategic caution

**Changes:**
```
Distance 2 food:
  - Health < 50: 1.0x (max multiplier) - NEW
  - 3+ move advantage: 0.3x → 0.8x
  - Contested: 0.05x → 0.2x

Distance 3+ food:
  - Health < 30 (distance 3-4): 0.5x - NEW
  - 4+ move advantage: 0.1x → 0.4x
  - 2+ move advantage: 0.1x - NEW
  - Contested: 1.0x (unchanged)
```

**Testing & Verification:**
- Replay match rates: 99-100% (highly deterministic)
- V9.1.1 "food aversion" cases appear to be correct strategic decisions
- Bot correctly prioritizes space control and entrapment avoidance over distant food
- V9.1.2 provides safety margin for edge cases while maintaining strategic play

**Score Impact:**
- Distance 2 with 3+ advantage: 11.25B → 30B (2.7x increase)
- Distance 2 at low health: 11.25B → 37.5B (3.3x increase)
- Distance 3-4 with 4+ advantage: 3.75B → 15B (4x increase)

### V9.1.1 - Critical Food Acquisition Fix: Cycling Elimination
**Status:** COMPLETED - January 2025
**Key Fix:**
- ✅ **CYCLING BUG ELIMINATED**: Bot no longer spins in circles around adjacent safe food
- ✅ Simplified urgency multiplier logic: ALWAYS use max multiplier (1000x) for distance-1 food
- ✅ Increased immediate_food_bonus: 5,000 → 500,000 (100x increase)
- ✅ Result: Adjacent food now scores 37.5B (500K × 1000 × 75), dominating all other factors

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- V9 cycling bug: Bot with health=95 would spin around adjacent safe food instead of eating
- Caused by conditional urgency multipliers based on `is_food_actually_safe()` checks
- Even "safe" food only got 200x-1000x multipliers, resulting in 1M-5M final scores
- Future penalties from search tree (death predictions, space constraints) overwhelmed food bonus
- Solution: ALWAYS max multiplier + massive base bonus = 37.5B score for distance-1 food

**Fix Implementation:**
- Simplified src/bot.rs:1912-1916 to unconditionally use max multiplier for distance-1 food
- Removed complex opponent-contestation logic that was too conservative
- Increased Snake.toml:171 immediate_food_bonus from 5000 to 500000
- Final score: 500,000 × 1000.0 × 75.0 = 37,500,000,000 (dominates all penalties)

**Testing & Verification:**
- Analyzed 3 games from optimized_v9 fixtures (213 total turns)
- V9 cycling events: 29 total (Game 1: 3, Game 2: 10, Game 3: 16)
- V9.1.1 cycling events: 0 total ✅
- Move corrections: 53-76% of moves changed across games
- Example turn 5 game 3: Bot at (9,0), food at (8,0), now chooses "left" (eat) instead of "right" (avoid)
- All 213 moves validated as legal (no self-collisions) ✅
- All deaths are legitimate traps (not self-intersections) ✅
- Search depth improved: 2.6 → 6.2 average (better time budget utilization)

**Impact:**
- Cycling behavior completely eliminated in all test scenarios
- More aggressive food acquisition throughout games
- Improved time efficiency (deeper search due to better move ordering)
- No new dubious behaviors introduced

### V9 - Time Management & Search Efficiency
**Status:** COMPLETED - January 2025
**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Time Management with Early Exit**: Stop searching when outcome is decided or no improvement
- ✅ **Certain Win Detection**: Exit search at depth N if score ≥ 1M (certain win threshold)
- ✅ **Certain Loss Detection**: Exit search at depth N if score ≤ -1M (forced loss threshold)
- ✅ **No Improvement Tracking**: Exit early if score hasn't improved for 2+ iterations with <33% time remaining
- ✅ **Builds on V8.2**: Retains food acquisition fix and all previous improvements

**Implementation Details:**
- Added tracking variables: `previous_best_score`, `depth_since_improvement` (src/bot.rs:914-915)
- Added three early exit conditions after each depth completes (src/bot.rs:1061-1082)
- New configuration parameters:
  - `certain_win_threshold = 1000000` (Snake.toml:21)
  - `certain_loss_threshold = -1000000` (Snake.toml:23)
  - `no_improvement_tolerance = 2` (Snake.toml:25)

**Expected Impact:**
- Save 10-20% computation time in decided positions
- Enable deeper search in competitive games by conserving time
- Reduce wasted iterations when position is clearly won/lost

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Early exit triggers when: (1) certain win, (2) forced loss, (3) no score improvement for 2+ depths with low time
- Preserves anytime property: always has a valid move from previous iteration
- Depth tracking resets when score improves, continues search while making progress

### V8.2 - Escape Route Bug Fix
**Status:** COMPLETED - January 2025
**Key Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed spurious escape route penalty when `just_ate_food=true`
- ✅ V8.1 issue: escape route check used wrong food position (the one we just ate was gone!)
- ✅ Solution: Skip escape route check entirely when `just_ate_food` (src/bot.rs:1892)

**Root Cause:**
- When evaluating states where we just ate food (health==100), the food we ate is removed from board
- Looking up "nearest food" finds a DIFFERENT food, applying penalties for wrong position
- Escape route penalty (-1500) cancelled out the +375M food bonus, causing cycling behavior

---

### V8.1 - Critical Food Acquisition Fix
**Status:** COMPLETED - January 2025
**Key Fix:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: immediate_food_bonus now triggers when food is EATEN, not just when adjacent
- ✅ Previous bug: Search tree never saw value in moves that acquire food (health==100 states were excluded)
- ✅ New logic: Apply max multiplier (1000x) to states where we just ate food (health==100)
- ✅ Result: Food-eating moves now get +375M score bonus (5000 × 1000 × 75), making them highly attractive

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- V8 only applied immediate_food_bonus when `snake.health < 100 && adjacent to food`
- When evaluating moves that EAT food, resulting state has health==100, so bonus was skipped
- Search tree evaluated food moves with NORMAL scoring, not the massive urgency multipliers
- Other factors (space, positioning) dominated decisions, causing persistent food avoidance

**Fix Implementation:**
- Added `just_ate_food = snake.health == 100` detection (src/bot.rs:1844)
- Modified bonus condition to include `|| just_ate_food` (src/bot.rs:1851)
- Apply max urgency_multiplier (1000x) when `just_ate_food` (src/bot.rs:1871-1873)
- States with health==100 now get +375M bonus, ensuring food acquisition is valued

**Expected Results:**
- Food avoidance: Target <5% (from V8's 14%)
- Food acquisition becomes dominant factor in decision-making
- Bot should aggressively pursue safe food even at moderate health levels

---

### V8 - Hierarchical Evaluation & Smart Food Safety
**Status:** PARTIAL - Food avoidance persisted at 14% due to bonus timing bug
**Key Features:**
- ✅ Implemented smart food safety check (is_food_actually_safe) - predicts post-eating traps
- ✅ Added hierarchical evaluation with capped urgency multipliers (max 1000x instead of unlimited)
- ✅ Implemented growth urgency strategy - incentivizes eating to match opponent lengths
- ✅ Fixed V7.2 issue where food marked "SAFE" but opponent could trap after eating
- ✅ All opponent iterations now use IDAPOS-filtered active_snakes for efficiency

**Implementation Details:**
- New function: is_food_actually_safe() checks: (1) Can opponent reach first? (2) Do they want it? (3) Can they trap us post-eating?
- Configurable survival thresholds: survival_max_multiplier=1000.0, survival_health_threshold=20
- Growth urgency: +500 per length unit behind smallest opponent, +100 when ahead
- Three-tier urgency multipliers: max (health<20), 10% of max (health<70), 1% of max (health≥70)

**Target Results:**
- Food avoidance: Target <10% (from V7.2's 18%)
- Average snake length: Target >6 (from V7.2's 3-4)
- Better decision-making near walls and in competitive scenarios

**Next Steps:** Benchmark V8 against V7.2 to validate improvements

### V7.2 - Temporal Discounting Implementation
**Status:** COMPLETED - January 2025
**Key Features:**
- ✅ Implemented temporal discounting (0.95^depth) to reduce weight of distant predictions
- ✅ Added depth_from_root tracking throughout search tree (maxn_search, alpha_beta_minimax)
- ✅ Applied discount formula: score × (temporal_discount_factor ^ depth_from_root)

**Results:**
- Food avoidance: 18% (improved from V7.1's 21%)
- Fixed critical health scenarios (Turn 111: health=15, now correctly takes adjacent food)
- Partial fix for moderate health scenarios (Turn 75: health=51, still conservative)

**Remaining Issues:**
- Simplistic food safety check (only checks opponent distance to food, not post-eating traps)
- Future penalties still overwhelming immediate bonuses in some cases
- No growth urgency when significantly shorter than opponents
- Bot stays small (length 3-4) while opponents grow to 7-9

**Next Steps:** See V8_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for comprehensive improvement strategy

## Verified Optimizations (Already Implemented) - V10 Audit

### ✅ **AdaptiveTimeEstimator IS Being Used**
**Claim:** "AdaptiveTimeEstimator Never Used"
**Reality:** ✅ INCORRECT - It IS actively used!
- Instantiated: src/bot.rs:947 (1v1) and src/bot.rs:1049 (multiplayer)
- Used for time estimation blending empirical data with exponential model
- Configuration: model_weight = 0.1 (90% empirical, 10% model)

### ✅ **Control Maps Already Use Vec, Not HashMap**
**Claim:** "HashMap for Control Map is slower than flat array"
**Reality:** ✅ INCORRECT - Already using Vec!
- Implementation: src/bot.rs:1719 uses `vec![None; size]`
- No HashMap performance issues
- Efficient flat array access

### ✅ **IDAPOS Already Aggressive**
**Claim:** "Conservative IDAPOS with multiplier=2"
**Reality:** ✅ INCORRECT - Already optimized!
- Current: head_distance_multiplier = 1 (Snake.toml:302)
- Current: max_locality_distance = 5 (Snake.toml:307)
- At depth 10: considers snakes within distance 5 (not 10!), capped
- Battle royale efficiency: 1-2 active snakes typical

## Remaining Optimization Opportunities

### Transposition Table Enhancement
**Status:** Worth investigating
- Only stores single scores, not bounds (should store EXACT, LOWER_BOUND, UPPER_BOUND types)
- No move storage (should store best move to improve move ordering)
- Simple age-based eviction instead of replacement schemes like TT-priority

### Move Ordering Improvements
**Status:** Partially implemented
- ✅ Killer moves already implemented (Snake.toml:32)
- ✅ PV ordering already enabled (Snake.toml:34)
- Consider: History heuristic for quiet moves

### Quiescence Search Enhancement
**Status:** Implemented but could be tuned
- Already implemented for tactical positions
- May need tuning for food contestation scenarios
